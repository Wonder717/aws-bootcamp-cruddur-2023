# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

This program commenced on a very high note and ensured that participants were properly informed on the prerequisites and essentials to get started and be successful in the program. On a personal level, I took the initiative to review each course content to get a better understanding of what is expected of me, and also carried out the required tasks for the week such as completing the knowledge challenges in the student portal, and designing the conceptual diagram for the application to be built.
